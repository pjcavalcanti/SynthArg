# TODO LIST

1. Refactor to call expressions by "Propositions"
2. Test everything thoroughly
3. Serialize expressions
4. Serialize proofs
5. Make random searches for proofs using serializations
6. **REWRITE USING THE VISITOR PATTERN**
   1. Because "The Visitor pattern makes it easier to add new operations. Instead of having to modify both the interface and every variant class, we just need to create a new, e.g., Formula.Visitor implementation with all the code for our new operation. There is no change to existing classes or interfaces." (<https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp21/classes/28-little-languages-2/#@interpreter_pattern_makes>)
